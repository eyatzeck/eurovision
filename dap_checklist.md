# DAP Checklist

__DAP - Capstone Checklist__
- [ ] Introduction 
- [ ] Question - what your analysis is striving to answer 

__User Story:__
- [ ] Create a definition statement / question for your DAP Capstone example: 
  * I want to build a data analysis that answers the following question about (insert some or other subject here): My question is this ...(insert your question here ...).
- [ ] Write a Definition of the Audience / type of personas that might be interested in this analysis
- [ ] What datasets do I need to help me answer the above question for my particular audience?
  * Choose any publicly Internet-available dataset(s)
  * What research do I need to do to find data sources for my Capstone?
  * List resources researched: (links to websites / materials)
  * Note what you like about each resource and why you chose it
  * Name other reference sources you want to consult

__Your capstone: (Requirements)__
You will take your capstone project through the data Analytics Lifecycle, to show-case your achievements. 
- [ ] You are required to use 
  - [ ] Python  
  - [ ] Excel or SQL
  - [ ] Tableau 

In your presentation explain how you used the above 3 tools in your processes for your capstone. (Where applicable explain how / when you used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Web Scraping, Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub) 

- [ ] 1000 cell minimum
  * Can be one dataset or multiple datasets that equal 1000 cells in total.
  * Example: 30 columns x 34 rows = 1020 cells
  * Collect and wrangle that data in a programmatic fashion (see the process below)

- [ ] Generate charts, graphs or reports to visualize some insightful aspects from the data
- [ ] Add other materials to enhance the presentation:  Images,tables, graphics, descriptive information 

- [ ] Present your Capstone project to tell the Data Story
  - [ ] Make sure that you’re answering how you questioned your analysis and what your analysis is striving to answer.
  - [ ] In your presentation illustrate how you performed a particular step in the data wrangling / analytics process.
    * Step #1 – Discovery
      - [ ] Find data that addresses your question.
      - [ ] Become familiar with your data so that you know how you will end up using it.
      - [ ] Identify trends, patterns and some data cells / sections that might cause issues in analysis.
    * Step #2 – Structuring
      - [ ] Take your raw data and transform it to what you can work with.
        * Unstructured data is often text-heavy and contains things such as Dates, Numbers, ID codes, etc.
        * Example: - When using info scrapped from a website, you might parse HTML code, pull out what you need, and discard the rest.
    * Step #3 – Cleaning
      - [ ] Removes outliers that can potentially skew your results when analyzing the data.
      - [ ] Changes any null values and standardizes the data format to improve quality and consistency.
      - [ ] Identifies duplicate values, standardizes systems of measurements, fixes structural errors and typos, and validates the data to make it easier to handle.
  - [ ] Include the biggest challenge you overcame in creating the capstone.
